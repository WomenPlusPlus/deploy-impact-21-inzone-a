## Description 

The moodboard is included here to show the inspiration for the product style guide. The design concept is a clean and serious interface that evokes a friendly and calm user experience, free of distraction. The primary colors are shades of blue and gray, with red accents to highlight important information and guide the user's attention through the interface. The design aims to be simple and consistent. 

With students of all language abilities and with differing levels of connectivity, the design is deliberating in the background. It is meant to facilitate exam taking and coordinator workflows, without drawing attention, so users can be efficient and focus on the task at hand.  

The typeface is Epilogue, which is a freely available Google Font with a clean design that is easy to read. 

The Style Tile gives direction on how to use the brand assets for Spoky, including color codes, color hierarchy, font, and typeface hierarchy, as well as icons and buttons. The colored bubbles indicate if a question has not yet bet attempted (blue), is currently being worked on (blue cirlce), has been skipped (red), or needs attendance (white). 

Our name, Spoky, is derived from the spokes of a wheel. With the InZone hubs at the center, Spoky connects InZone students with University of Geneva to support and accelerate their learning goals.

These design choices are based on thorough competitor research that was mapped on Miro, conversations with the InZone Hub team members, persona research, and usability interviews that we conducted during the development process.
