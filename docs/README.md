### learning
We are here to learn new tools we have not used before, and new applications of tools already known to us. We collaborate and learn from each other. We connect with the mentors and benefit from their knowledge.

### product cycle
We are excited to experience a full product cycle where we observe putting methodologies we have only read about into action, and where we see how design meets development.

### impact
We strive to have an impact on refugee education opportunities. We empathise to understand their pain points, research their situation, and explore multiple solutions.

### focus
We focus on creating a minimal loveable product that adds value to the students and is doable within our project's scope.


<a name="productV"><h2>Product vision</h2></a>

*During the first sprint we conducted research and brainstorming to identify the most pressing issues InZone is facing. We came up with five problem statements to guide us through this project and to base our prioritization on.*

> As an educator &ndash; I want to empower my students &ndash; such that they can achieve their higher goals.

> As an educator &ndash; I need a way to verify my students offline &ndash; such that I trust it is them.

> As a student far away from the hub and with poor internet connectivity &ndash; I want to be able to take an official exam &ndash; such that I qualify for a certificate.

> As a student with many other responsibilities and no online access to help &ndash; I need a clear user journey &ndash; such that I do not drop out.

> As a student with basic English &ndash; I need to easily follow the app &ndash; such that I can focus on the exam.
