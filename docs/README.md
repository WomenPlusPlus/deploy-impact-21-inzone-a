### learning
We are here to learn new tools we have not used before, and new applications of tools already known to us. We collaborate and learn from each other. We connect with the mentors and benefit from their knowledge.

### product cycle
We are excited to experience a full product cycle where we observe putting methodologies we have only read about into action, and where we see how design meets development.

### impact
We strive to have an impact on refugee education opportunities. We empathise to understand their pain points, research their situation, and explore multiple solutions.

### focus
We focus on creating a minimal loveable product that adds value to the students and is doable within our project's scope.

*During the first sprint we conducted research and brainstorming to identify the most pressing issues InZone is facing. We came up with five problem statements to guide us through this project and to base our prioritization on.*

> As an educator &ndash; I want to empower my students &ndash; such that they can achieve their higher goals.

> As an educator &ndash; I need a way to verify my students offline &ndash; such that I trust it is them.

> As a student far away from the hub and with poor internet connectivity &ndash; I want to be able to take an official exam &ndash; such that I qualify for a certificate.

> As a student with many other responsibilities and no online access to help &ndash; I need a clear user journey &ndash; such that I do not drop out.

> As a student with basic English &ndash; I need to easily follow the app &ndash; such that I can focus on the exam.

<!-- First draft -->
Prerequisites:
- Javascript => High Level, Dynamic, Interpreted Language
- React* (https://reactjs.org/) => JavaScript library for building user interfaces
 
 To develop the app *spoky* we used:
 - React Native (https://reactnative.dev/) => React Native is a JavaScript framework for building cross-platform apps
 - Expo* (https://expo.dev/) => Set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate                                 on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase

      
 _*to use React and Expo you'll need to install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine_

Additional optional installations:
- Android Studio Emulator (https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) => run your Expo app on an Andoid emulator
- iOS Simulator (https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) => run your Expo app on an iOS simulator (only for macOs)
